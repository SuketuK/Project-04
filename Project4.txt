Project 4

1. Trying to predict salary based on location, title and summary
2) Then see if the salary is good or bad - compare to mean

logistic regressio to clasify the job (low, high) use median as your threshold

PArse title and create a column
dummeis for city
read summary and get some skills and create table for each skills





patsy.dmatrix(city)

lasso
RFE or kBest

classifitiaon modela as regression so returning probability on high and low both

logistric regression regressor as class in sklearn

run logis reg on binary classifier

model
1. feature and target --> (we have shape, 
2. splitter (train test) --> 
3. scaling
4. transform on both
step 1 is from project 3 standard_regression
5.

The problem statement is: we are trying to classify job is high or low paying based on title/key word
